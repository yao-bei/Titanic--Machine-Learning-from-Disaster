How it works:
#Compute x = 4 * 3 and print the result
x = 4 * 3
print(x)

#Compute y = 6 * 9 and print the result
y = 6*9
print(y)

Get the Data with Pandas:
# Import the Pandas library
import pandas as pd
# Load the train and test datasets to create two DataFrames
train_url = "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/train.csv"
train = pd.read_csv(train_url)

test_url = "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/test.csv"
test = pd.read_csv(test_url)
#Print the `head` of the train and test dataframes
print(train.head())
print(test.head())

Understanding your data:
.describe()
.shape

Rose vs Jack, or Female vs Male:
# Passengers that survived vs passengers that passed away
print(train["Survived"].value_counts())

# As proportions
print(train["Survived"].value_counts(normalize = True))

# Males that survived vs males that passed away
print(train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'male'].value_counts())

# Females that survived vs Females that passed away
print(train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'female'].value_counts())

# Normalized male survival
print(train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'male'].value_counts(normalize = True))

# Normalized female survival
print(train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'female'].value_counts(normalize = True))

Does age play a role?:
# Create the column Child and assign to 'NaN'
train["Child"] = float('NaN')

# Assign 1 to passengers under 18, 0 to those 18 or older. Print the new column.

train["Child"][train["Age"] < 18] = 1
train["Child"][train["Age"] >= 18] = 0
print(train["Child"])


# Print normalized Survival Rates for passengers under 18
print(train["Survived"][train["Child"] == 1].value_counts(normalize = True))

# Print normalized Survival Rates for passengers 18 or older
print(train["Survived"][train["Child"] == 0].value_counts(normalize = True))

First Prediction:
# Create a copy of test: test_one
test_one=test

# Initialize a Survived column to 0
test_one["Survived"]=0

# Set Survived to 1 if Sex equals "female" and print the `Survived` column from `test_one`
test_one["Survived"][test_one["Sex"] == "female"]=1
print(test_one["Survived"])
