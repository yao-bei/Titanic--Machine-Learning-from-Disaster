A Random Forest analysis in Python:
# Import the `RandomForestClassifier`
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# We want the Pclass, Age, Sex, Fare,SibSp, Parch, and Embarked variables
features_forest = train[["Pclass", "Age", "Sex", "Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"]].values

# Building and fitting my_forest
forest = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth = 10, min_samples_split=2, n_estimators = 100, random_state = 1)
my_forest = forest.fit(features_forest,target)

# Print the score of the fitted random forest
print(my_forest.score(features_forest, target))

# Compute predictions on our test set features then print the length of the prediction vector
test_features = test[["Pclass", "Age", "Sex", "Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"]].values
pred_forest = my_forest.predict(test_features)
print(len(pred_forest))

Interpreting and Comparing:
#Request and print the `.feature_importances_` attribute
print(my_tree_two.feature_importances_)
print(my_forest.feature_importances_)

#Compute and print the mean accuracy score for both models
print(my_tree_two.score(features_two, target))
print(my_forest.score(features_forest, target))

Conclude and Submit:
print(my_tree_two.feature_importances_)
print(my_forest.feature_importances_)
